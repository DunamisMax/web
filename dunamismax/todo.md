This gives us a solid foundation for the website. Here's what each component does:

1. **Project Structure**:
   - Organized following FastAPI best practices
   - Clear separation of concerns between API endpoints, templates, and static files
   - Modular approach for easy expansion

2. **Base CSS**:
   - Implements Nord theme with CSS variables
   - Global styles with Fira Code font
   - Responsive design basics
   - Component-specific styling

3. **Main Application**:
   - FastAPI setup with Jinja2 templates
   - WebSocket support for messenger
   - Structured logging with Loguru
   - Basic routing for all main pages

4. **Base Template**:
   - HTMX integration
   - Fira Code font loading
   - Responsive meta tags
   - Template inheritance structure

Next steps:

1. Create individual API endpoints in the `api/` directory
2. Build the messenger WebSocket implementation
3. Design the API playground interface
4. Implement the blog system
5. Create the about page

Would you like me to proceed with any of these next steps? Also, do you want to make any adjustments to what I've created so far?
